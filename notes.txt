we have an app class 

class App{

    router variable to be created;


    public function __construct(){
        instanciate the router class to be abailable everywhere 

        lets say we instantiate it to a variable 

    }

}

app->router->get();
but now this extends the class and not do the thing 
but the class is iunstanciated upon the calling of the app class
